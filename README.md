# Football

A website for information on matches, players, results, and maybe more, using the _football-data_ API by Daniel Freitag.
It's my first time using an API in a project that isn't a spoonfed tutorial, so I'm really trying to figure out various functions and exploring the wild possibilities of APIs. Also, my friends (well, some of them) and I love football, so why not, right?
